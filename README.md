[coala Language Server](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4971369184362496)

> coala as a linting and code fixing tool can be far more useful when its power can be directly leveraged from within the code editor. Since all the major IDE's and code editors are now starting to support the standard Microsoft Language Server protocol it is now possible to expose coala's capabilities via the one said protocol and support a wide range of code editors. This proposal outlines the project where I intend to build one such server loosely based upon the proof of concept implementation built for vs-code. It should see noticeable performance improvements, feature upgrades to support actions such as didChange, didSave etc, customization of bears from within the LSP, support for all languages coala supports and be a fully standards confirming general language server.
